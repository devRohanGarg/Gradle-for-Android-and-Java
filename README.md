#Gradle for Android and Java

Welcome!

Each directory contains a README.md or solution.gradle that will explain either
the concept being explored or the exercise at hand. For each exercise, hints
and a solution.gradle file are also provided.

This course is specifically concerned with the app build process, not writing
apps in the first place.
